# Lighthouse.el

This is package wraps the functionality of the
[lighthouse](https://github.com/finnkauski/lighthouse) command line tool and
allows changing your lights from inside _doom-emacs_

<br>

It will evolve as a tool as more functionality is added to `lighthouse`.

<br>

## Dependencies

[lighthouse](https://github.com/finnkauski/lighthouse) and make sure it is in
your path.

## NOTE:

This package is developed for
[doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) so tweaking and PRs are
welcome to make it more generic.
